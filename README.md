# Toptal Demo Project

## Requirements

A todo list management web application.

 - [✓] I can have my todo list displayed.

 - [✓] I can manipulate my list (add/remove/modify entries).

 - [✓] Assign priorities and due dates to the entries.

 - [✓] I can sort my entry lists using due date and priority.

 - [✓] I can mark an entry as completed.

 - [✓] Minimal UI/UX design is needed.

 - [✓] I need every client operation done using JavaScript, reloading the page is not an option.
 
 - [✓] Write a RESTful API which will allow a third-party application to trigger actions on your app (same actions available on the webpage).
 
 - [✓] You need to be able to pass credentials to both the webpage and the API.
 
 - [✓] As complementary to the last item, one should be able to create users in the system via an interface, probably a signup/register screen.

## Implementation

This project was implemented using two layers: a pure API layer, and a UI layer.

The API layer provides a programmable interface to manipulate a user's todo list.

The UI layer consumes the API and provides a web interface for the todo list.

For further information, please consult each layer's README.
